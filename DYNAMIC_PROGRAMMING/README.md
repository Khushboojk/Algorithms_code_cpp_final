# ROD CUTTING PROBLEM
----------------------


Problem Statement:- Given a rod of length n inches and a table of prices p i for i = 1; 2; : : : ; n, determine the maximum revenue r n obtainable by cutting up the rod and selling the pieces. Note that if the price p n for a rod of length n is large enough, an optimal solution may require no cutting at all.

Sample Input:- price table of size(n) = 10 ; price[i]:- 0 1 5 8 9 10 17 17 20 24 30 ;
 length of rod(length) = 8 ;

Sample Output:- revenue[i] for i=0 to 8 :- 0 1 5 8 10 13 17 18 22 ; solution[i] for i=0 to 8:- 0 1 2 3 2 2 6 1 2 ; length of optimal pieces of rod of size = 8 is 2, 6 ;
